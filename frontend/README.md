# Frontend Application

## Description

This directory contains the frontend application for the E-Commerce project. It is a React-based single-page application (SPA) that interacts with the backend API to provide a rich user experience for browsing products, managing user accounts, and placing orders.

## Technologies Used

- React
- TypeScript
- Redux (for state management)
- React Router (for navigation)
- Sass (for styling)

## Installation

To set up the frontend application locally, follow these steps:

1.  Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    ```

## Usage

To start the development server:

```bash
npm start
# or yarn start
```

The application will typically open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at a later time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
